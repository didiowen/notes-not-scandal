## Vegetation

* The prototypic lesion of infective endocarditis (IE), the vegetation, is a mass of **platelets, fibrin, microorganisms, and scant inflammatory cells**.   
:::  
  
::: block  
  
* Infection most commonly involves **heart valves** but may also occur on:   
	* The low-pressure side of a ventricular septal defect  
	* Mural endocardium damaged by aberrant jets of blood or foreign bodies  
	* Intracardiac devices  
* The analogous process involving arteriovenous shunts, arterio-arterial shunts (patent ductus arteriosus), or a coarctation of the aorta is called **infective endarteritis**.

</split>

## Classification  
  
* According to the **temporal** evolution of disease, the **site** of infection, the **cause** of infection, or the **predisposing risk factor** (e.g., injection drug use, health care–associated).   
	* **_Acute IE_** is a hectically febrile illness that rapidly damages cardiac structures, seeds extracardiac sites, and, if untreated, progresses to death within weeks.   
	* **_Subacute IE_** follows an indolent course; causes structural cardiac damage only slowly, if at all; rarely metastasizes; and is gradually progressive unless complicated by a major embolic event or a ruptured mycotic aneurysm.  
  
---  
  
## Epidemiology  
  
* In the United States and likely in other developed countries, the incidence of IE is estimated to be 12 cases per 100,000 population per year, with progressive **increases** during recent decades.   
* While congenital heart diseases remain a constant predisposition, predisposing conditions in developed countries have shifted from chronic rheumatic heart disease (still common in developing countries) to **injection drug use, degenerative valve disease, and intracardiac devices**.   
* The incidence of IE is notably increased among the **elderly**.   
  
---  
  
* In developed countries, 25–35% of cases of native-valve endocarditis (NVE) are health care–associated, and 16–30% of all cases are prosthetic-valve infections (PVE).   
* The risk of PVE is greatest during the **initial year** after valve replacement  
	* Gradually declines to a low, stable rate thereafter  
	* Greater for **bioprosthetic** valves than mechanical valves   
* The incidence of infection involving transcatheter implanted aortic valves (TAVR-PVE) per 100 patient-years (PY) is 1.4–2.8 in the first year and 0.8 in each of the ensuing 4 years.   
	* The incidence is similar to that for surgically implanted **bioprosthetic aortic valves**.   
* IE involving cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIED-IE)—greater on **implanted defibrillators and resynchronization devices** than on permanent pacemakers—occurs in 0.5–1.14 cases per 1000 recipients.  
  
---  
  
# Etiology  
  
![[../attachments/Infective Endocarditis.png| 1600]]  
  
---  
  
* Although many species of bacteria and fungi cause sporadic episodes of IE, a few bacterial species cause the majority of cases   
* Recent large studies from developed areas identify *Staphylococcus aureus* as the most common bacterial species causing IE.   
* **The oral cavity, skin, and upper respiratory tract** are the respective primary portals for viridans streptococci, staphylococci, and HACEK organisms (*Haemophilus* species, *Aggregatibacter* species, *Cardiobacterium hominis*, *Eikenella corrodens*, and *Kingella kingae*).   
* *Streptococcus gallolyticus* subspecies gallolyticus (formerly *S. bovis* biotype 1) originates from the **gastrointestinal tract** and is associated with **colonic polyps and tumors**.   
* Enterococci enter the bloodstream primarily from the **genitourinary tract**.  
  
---  
  
## Health care–associated IE  
  
* Health care–associated IE, most commonly caused by ***S. aureus*, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and enterococci**, may have either a nosocomial onset (55%) or a community onset (45%).   
* IE complicates **8–25%** of episodes of catheter-associated *S. aureus* bacteremia.  
  
---  
  
## Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis  
  
* PVE arising within **2 months** of valve surgery—i.e., early PVE—is generally **nosocomial** and is the result of intraoperative contamination of the prosthesis or a postoperative infection.   
	* This nosocomial origin is reflected in the microbial causes: **_S. aureus_, CoNS, facultative gram-negative bacilli, diphtheroids, and fungi**.   
* The portals of entry and organisms causing PVE beginning **>12 months** after surgery—i.e., late PVE—are similar to those in **community**-acquired NVE.   
* Regardless of the time of onset after surgery, at least 68–85% of **CoNS** strains that cause PVE are **resistant to methicillin**.   
* The microbiology of TAVR-PVE, while generally similar to that of PVE, is notable for an increased frequency of **enterococci**.   
	* Risk factors associated with TAVR-PVE include male sex, diabetes, renal failure, and moderate postimplantation aortic valve regurgitation.  
  
---  
  
## CIED-IE  
  
* Involves the device or the endothelium at points of device contact  
	* Occasionally, there is concurrent aortic or mitral valve infection.   
* One-third of cases of CIED IE present within 3 months after device implantation or manipulation, one-third between 4–12 months, and one-third >1 year.   
* ==**_S. aureus_ and CoNS**== cause the majority of cases.  
  
---  
  
## IE in people who inject drugs (PWID)  
  
* Especially involving the tricuspid valve  
	* Commonly caused by **_S. aureus_**, which is often ==**resistant to methicillin**==  
* Left-sided valve infections in PWID has a more varied etiology  
* In addition to the usual causes of IE, infection due to **Enterobacterales, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Candida_ species**, and sporadically by unusual organisms (_Bacillus_, _Lactobacillus_, _Corynebacterium_ species) is encountered.   
* **==HIV infection in PWID does not significantly alter the causes of IE.==**  
  
---  
  
## Culture-Negative IE  
  
* About **5–15%** of patients with IE have negative blood cultures  
	* One-third to one-half of these cases due to **prior antibiotic exposure**  
* The remainder are infected by **fastidious organisms**, such as some streptococci, nutritionally variant bacteria now designated **_Granulicatella_ and _Abiotrophia_ species, HACEK organisms, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _Bartonella_ species**  
	* _Tropheryma whipplei_ causes an indolent, culture-negative, afebrile form of IE.   
	* **_C. burnetii_** has a predilection for **prosthetic valves**.   
	* **_Corynebacterium_ species and _Propionibacterium acnes_** may involve intracardiac devices and be slow to grow in blood cultures.   
	* ***Mycobacterium chimaera***, which may be difficult to recover from blood cultures unless **special media** is used, has caused a **global outbreak of PVE** and disseminated infection as a result of aerosols from contaminated heater-cooler machines used during **cardiopulmonary bypass**.   
* **Atrial myxoma, marantic endocarditis, and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome** may mimic culture-negative IE.  
  
---  
  
# Pathogenesis  
  
---  
  
## Host  
  
* The undamaged endothelium is resistant to infection by most bacteria.   
* **Endothelial injury** (e.g., at the site of impact of high-velocity blood jets or on the low-pressure side of a cardiac structural lesion) allows either direct infection by virulent organisms or the development of a **platelet–fibrin thrombus—a condition called _nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis_ (NBTE)**.   
	* This thrombus serves as a site of bacterial attachment during transient bacteremia.   
	* The cardiac conditions most commonly resulting in NBTE are **mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, ventricular septal defects, and complex congenital heart disease**.   
	* NBTE also arises as a result of a hypercoagulable state; this phenomenon gives rise to **_marantic endocarditis_** (uninfected vegetations seen in patients with malignancy and chronic diseases) and to bland vegetations complicating systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.  
  
---  
%%  
## Pathogen  
  
* Organisms that cause IE enter the bloodstream from colonized body surfaces or sites of infection.   
* _S. aureus_ adherence:   
	* **Intact** endothelium: may be mediated by local inflammation inducing **von Willebrand factor** on endothelial cell surfaces with resulting adherence of both **platelets** and _S. aureus_   
	* **Injured** endothelium: may be mediated by local deposition of fibrin and circulating von Willebrand factor on exposed subendothelial tissue to which in turn _S. aureus_ adhere directly.  
* Other microorganisms in the blood adhere to NBTE.   
  
---  
  
* The organisms that commonly cause IE have surface adhesin molecules, collectively called **microbial surface components recognizing adhesin matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs)** that mediate adherence to NBTE sites or injured endothelium.   
	* Adherence is facilitated by:  
		* fibronectin-binding proteins present on many gram-positive bacteria;   
		* clumping factor (a fibrinogen- and fibrin-binding surface protein) on _S. aureus_;   
		* fibrinogen-binding surface proteins (Fss2), collagen-binding surface protein (Ace), and Ebp pili (the latter mediating platelet adherence) on _Enterococcus faecalis_;  
		* glucans or FimA (a member of the family of oral mucosal adhesins) on streptococci.   
	* Fibronectin-binding proteins are required for _S. aureus_ **invasion** of intact endothelium; thus, these surface proteins may facilitate infection of previously normal valves.   
* If resistant to the bactericidal activity of serum and the microbicidal peptides released locally by **platelets**, adherent organisms proliferate to form dense **microcolonies**.   
* Microorganisms also induce platelet deposition and a localized procoagulant state by eliciting **tissue factor** from the endothelium and, in the case of _S. aureus,_ from monocytes as well.   
* **Fibrin deposition** combines with **platelet aggregation** and microorganism proliferation to generate an infected vegetation.   
  
---  
%%  
  
* **Metabolically inactive (nongrowing)** organisms deep in vegetations → **relatively resistant to killing** by antimicrobial agents  
* Proliferating surface organisms are shed into the bloodstream continuously.  
	* **Embolization** of vegetation fragments leading to infection or infarction of remote tissues  
	* **Hematogenous infection** of sites during bacteremia  
* Constitutional symptoms: which probably result from **cytokine** production  
* Damage to **intracardiac structures** → valve regurgitation, intracardiac fistulae, chordae tendineae rupture, heart failure  
* Tissue injury due to the deposition of **circulating immune complexes** or immune responses to deposited bacterial antigens  
  
---  
  
# Clinical Manifestations  
  
---  
  
* The highly variable clinical IE syndrome spans a continuum between acute and subacute presentations.   
* The causative microorganism is primarily responsible for the temporal course of IE.   
	* β-Hemolytic streptococci, _S. aureus_, and pneumococci typically result in an **acute** course, although _S. aureus_ occasionally causes subacute disease.   
	* IE caused by **_Staphylococcus lugdunensis_** (a coagulase-negative species) or by enterococci may present acutely.   
	* **Subacute** IE is typically caused by viridans streptococci, enterococci, CoNS, and the HACEK group.   
	* IE caused by _Bartonella_ species, _T. whipplei_, _C. burnetii_, or _M. chimaera_ is exceptionally **indolent**.  
* Most forms of IE share clinical and laboratory manifestations  
* In patients with subacute presentations, fever is typically low-grade rarely exceeding 39.4°C; temperatures of 39.4°–40°C are often noted in acute IE.   
* Fever may be blunted in patients who are **elderly, are severely debilitated, or have renal failure**.

## Cardiac Manifestations  
  
* Although **heart murmurs** are usually indicative of the **predisposing** cardiac pathology rather than of IE, valvular damage and ruptured chordae may result in new regurgitant murmurs.   
* In acute IE involving a normal valve, murmurs may be **absent initially** but ultimately are detected in 85% of cases.   
* Congestive heart failure (CHF) resulting from valve dysfunction or, occasionally, **intracardiac fistulae** develops in 30–40% of patients.   
* Extension of leaflet infection into adjacent annular or myocardial tissue results in **paravalvular abscesses**, which in turn may cause intracardiac fistulae with new murmurs.   
* Aortic paravalvular infection may burrow into the upper ventricular septum and interrupt the conduction system, leading to varying degrees of **heart block**.   
* Mitral paravalvular abscesses are more distant from the conduction system and rarely cause conduction abnormalities.   
* **Coronary artery emboli** occur in 2% of patients and may result in **myocardial infarction**.  
  
---  
  
## Noncardiac Manifestations  
  
* The classic **nonsuppurative** peripheral manifestations of **subacute IE (e.g., Janeway lesions)** are related to prolonged infection; with early diagnosis and treatment, these have become infrequent.   
* In contrast, **septic embolization** mimicking some of these lesions **(subungual hemorrhage, Osler’s nodes)** is common in patients with **acute _S. aureus_ IE**.   
* Musculoskeletal pain usually remits promptly with treatment but must be distinguished from **focal metastatic infections (e.g., spondylodiscitis)**, which may complicate 10–15% of cases.   
* Hematogenously seeded focal infection occurs most often in the **skin, spleen, kidneys, skeletal system, and meninges**.

---  
  
* Arterial emboli, one-half of which **precede** the diagnosis of IE, are clinically apparent in up to **50%** of patients.   
	* **_S. aureus_ IE, mobile vegetations >10 mm in diameter, and infection involving the mitral valve anterior leaflet** are independently associated with an increased risk of embolization.  
	* Embolic arterial occlusion causes regional pain or ischemia-induced organ dysfunction (e.g., of the kidney, spleen, bowel, extremity).   
	* Cerebrovascular emboli presenting as strokes or occasionally as encephalopathy complicate 15–35% of cases; however, evidence of clinically asymptomatic emboli is found on MRI in 30–65% of patients with left-sided IE.   
	* The frequency of stroke is 8 per 1000 patient-days during the week prior to diagnosis and decreases to 4.8 and 1.7 per 1000 patient-days during the first and second weeks of effective antimicrobial therapy, respectively.  
	* Only **3%** of strokes occur after 1 week of effective therapy.   
	* Emboli occurring late during or after effective therapy do **not** in themselves constitute evidence of failed antimicrobial treatment.  
  
---  
  
* Other neurologic complications include aseptic or **purulent meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage due to hemorrhagic infarcts or ruptured mycotic aneurysms, and seizures**.   
	* **_Mycotic aneurysms_** are focal dilations of arteries occurring at points in the artery wall that have been weakened by infection in the vasa vasorum or where septic emboli have lodged.   
	* **Microabscesses** in the brain and meninges occur commonly in _S. aureus_ IE; intracerebral abscesses requiring surgical drainage are infrequent.  
* **Immune complex deposition** on the glomerular basement membrane causes diffuse hypocomplementemic **glomerulonephritis** and renal dysfunction, which typically improve with effective antimicrobial therapy.   
* Embolic renal infarcts cause **flank pain and hematuria** but rarely renal dysfunction.  
  
---  
  
## Manifestations with Specific Predisposing Conditions  
  
* Among PWID, 35–60% of IE is limited to the ==**tricuspid valve**== and presents with fever but with **faint or no murmur and without peripheral manifestations**.   
	* **Septic pulmonary emboli**, which are common with tricuspid IE, cause cough, pleuritic chest pain, nodular pulmonary infiltrates, and occasionally empyema or pyopneumothorax.   
* Health care–associated IE has typical manifestations unless associated with an intracardiac device or masked by the symptoms of concurrent illness.   
	* CIED-IE may be associated with obvious (especially within 6 months of device manipulation) or cryptic **generator pocket infection**, or arise through bacteremic seeding without pocket infection.   
		* Fever, sepsis, minimal murmur, and occasionally pulmonary symptoms due to septic emboli are seen.   
	* Late-onset PVE and TAVR-PVE present with typical clinical features.   
		* In early PVE, symptoms may be masked by recent surgery.   
		* In both early and late PVE, paravalvular infection is common and often results in partial valve dehiscence, regurgitant murmurs, CHF, or disruption of the conduction system.  
  
---  
  
# Diagnosis  
  
* Careful clinical, microbiologic, and echocardiographic evaluations should be pursued when febrile patients have **IE predispositions, cardiac or noncardiac (e.g., stroke or splenic infarct) features of IE, or blood cultures yielding an IE-associated organism**.  
* The diagnosis of IE is established with certainty only when vegetations are examined histologically and microbiologically.   
* A common clinical approach utilizes a sensitive and specific diagnostic schema—**the modified Duke criteria**—based on clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic findings commonly encountered in patients with IE.   
  
---  
  
## Modified Duke Criteria   
  
### Major Criteria  
  
1. Microbiologic Major Criteria  
	1. Positive blood cultures  
		1. Microorganisms that commonly causes IE<sup>#</sup> isolated from two or more separate blood culture sets  
		2. Microorganisms that occasionally or rarely causes IE isolated from two or more separate blood culture sets  
	2. Positive laboratory results  
		1. Positive PCR or other nucleic acid-based technique for *C. burnetii*, *Bartonella* spp., or *T. whipplei*   
		2. Single positive blood culture for _Coxiella burnetii_ or phase I IgG antibody titer of >1:800  
		3. Indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to *Bartonella henselae* or *Bartonella quintana* with IgG titer ≥ 1:800  
  
---  
  
<sup>#</sup> *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Staphylococcus lugdunensis*, *Enterococcus faecalis*, all streptococcal species except *S. pneumoniae* and *S. pyogenes*, *Granulicatella*, *Abiotrophia*, and *Gemella* species, HACEK group organisms; in the setting of intracardiac prosthetic material, the following additional bacteria are also included as "typical" pathogens: ==**coagulase negative staphylococci**==, *Corynebacterium striatum* and *C. jeikeium*, *Serratia marcescens*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Cutibacterium acnes*, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (especially *M. chimaerae*), and *Candida* spp.  
  
---  
  
2. Imaging Major Criteria  
	1. Echocardiography and Cardiac Computed Tomography Imaging  
		1. Vegetation, valvular/leaflet perforation, valvular/leaflet aneurysm, abscess, pseudoaneurysm, or intracardiac fistula  
		2. Significant new valvular regurgitation on echocardiography as compared to previous imaging. Worsening or changing of pre-existing regurgitation is not sufficient  
		3. New partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve as compared to previous imaging  
	2. [18F]FDG PET/CT Imaging: abnormal metabolic activity involving a native or prosthetic valve, ascending aortic graft (with concomitant evidence of valve involvement), intracardiac device leads or other prosthetic material  
3. Surgical Major Criteria: evidence of IE documented by direct inspection during heart surgery neither Major Imaging Criteria nor subsequent histologic or microbiologic confirmation  
    
---  
  
### Minor Criteria  
1. Predisposition:   
	1. Previous history of IE  
	2. More than mild stenosis or regurgitation  
	3. Prosthetic valve  
	4. Previous valve repair  
	5. Congenital heart disease  
	6. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  
	7. Injection drug use  
	8. Endovascular CIED  
2. Fever ≥38.0°C  
3. Vascular phenomena: major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, cerebral or splenic abscess, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, Janeway lesions  
4. Immunologic phenomena: immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, Osler’s nodes, Roth’s spots, rheumatoid factor  
  
---  
  
5. Microbiologic evidence falling short of a major criterion  
	1. Positive blood cultures for a microorganism consistent with IE but not meeting the requirements for Major Criterion  
	2. Positive culture, PCR or other nucleic acid based test (amplicon or shotgun sequencing, in situ hybridization) for an organism consistent with IE from a sterile body site other than cardiac tissue, cardiac prosthesis, or embolus; or a single finding of a skin bacterium by PCR on a valve or wire without additional clinical or microbiological supporting evidence  
6. Imaging criteria: abnormal metabolic activity as detected [18F]FDG PET/CT within 3 months of implantation of prosthetic valve, ascending aortic graft (with concomitant evidence of valve involvement), intracardiac device leads to other prosthetic material  
7. Physical examination criteria: new valvular regurgitation identified on auscultation, if echocardiography is not available. Worsening or changing of pre-exisiting murmur not sufficient.  
  
 <span style="font-size:medium">Ref: 10.1093/cid/ciad271</span>  
  
---  
  
* Definite IE:  
	* Two major criteria;   
	* One major criterion and three minor criteria; or  
	* Five minor criteria  
* Possible IE:  
	* One major and one minor criteria; or  
	* Three minor criteria  
* Rejected IE:   
	* **An alternative diagnosis** is established;  
	* Symptoms resolve and do not recur with **≤4 days of antibiotic therapy**; or  
	* Surgery or autopsy after ≤4 days of antimicrobial therapy yields no histologic evidence of IE  
* Patients with definite and possible IE are treated as having IE  
  
---  
  
* The blood culture requirement emphasizes multiple positive blood cultures over time (consistent with the continuous bacteremia characteristic of IE) and the bacterial species that commonly cause IE.   
* To fulfill a major criterion, an organism that causes both IE and non-IE-related bacteremia (e.g., _S. aureus_, enterococci) must be recovered in **multiple blood cultures** and the clinical presentation be **unexplained** by an extracardiac focus of infection.   
* Organisms that commonly contaminate blood cultures (e.g., diphtheroids, CoNS) must be found in **repeated** blood cultures to satisfy a major criterion.  
* **Transesophageal echocardiography** is required for optimal assessment of possible **prosthetic valve endocarditis or complicated endocarditis**.   
  
---  
  
## Blood Cultures  
  
* In patients with suspected NVE, PVE, TAVR-PVE, or CIED-IE who have not received antibiotics during the prior 2 weeks, **three two-bottle blood culture sets** containing the appropriate volume of blood (10 mL per bottle) should be obtained from **different venipuncture sites over 1–2 hours**.   
* If the cultures remain negative after 48–72 h, two or three additional blood culture sets should be obtained, and the laboratory should be consulted for advice regarding optimal culture techniques.   
* Pending culture results, empirical antimicrobial therapy should be **withheld initially from hemodynamically and clinically stable** patients with suspected **subacute IE**, especially those who have received antibiotics within the preceding 2 weeks.   
	* The delay allows blood for additional cultures to be obtained without the confounding effect of empirical treatment.   
* Patients with sepsis or deteriorating hemodynamics who may require urgent surgery should receive empirical treatment immediately after the initial three sets of blood cultures are obtained.  
  
---  
  
## Non-Blood-Culture Tests  
  
* Serologic tests can be used to implicate organisms that are difficult to recover by blood culture such as **_Brucella_, _Bartonella_, _T. whipplei_, and _C. burnetii_**.   
* In vegetations recovered at surgery or by embolectomy, pathogens can be identified by **culture** and **histopathologic examination with special stain**s.   
* A sample of the vegetation should be collected using sterile technique and saved for molecular testing using **polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** with organism-specific primers or broad-range PCR targeting **16S ribosomal RNA** (or **28S rRNA**, if fungi are suspected) followed by sequencing for organism identification.   
	* Molecular testing is a useful diagnostic technology when the histopathology of a vegetation is consistent with IE; however, it cannot be used to establish the **viability** of residual bacteria in vegetations.   
	* Molecular testing is only moderately sensitive and thus **a negative test cannot exclude IE**.   
	* When tissue is limited, molecular testing should be **prioritized over culture**.   
* **Next-generation (shotgun metagenomic) sequencing**   
  
---  
  
### Cardiac Imaging  
  
* Echocardiography anatomically confirms and measures vegetations, detects intracardiac complications, and assesses cardiac function.   
* **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is exceptionally **specific**; however, in **20%** of patients the images are inadequate.   
	* TTE fails to detect vegetations in 20–35% of patients with definite clinical IE, missing vegetations **<2 mm** in diameter.   
	* It is not optimal for evaluating **prosthetic valves**, especially TAVR with large stents, or detecting **intracardiac complications**.   
* **TEE** detects vegetations in **>90%** of patients with definite IE; nevertheless, initial studies may yield false-negative results in **6–18%** of IE patients, especially in **TAVR-PVE**.   
	* A negative TEE, when IE is likely, does **not** exclude the diagnosis but rather warrants repeating the study in **7–10 days**.   
  
---  
  
* Other imaging, if available, should be pursued when anatomic confirmation of IE is unclear, when TEE is not confirmatory or is contraindicated, and in suspected **PVE**.   
* **Electrocardiographic-gated multislice cardiac CT angiogram (CTA)**, which is comparable to TEE in detection of vegetations and possibly superior in defining **paravalvular** infection, may be definitive.  
* While less sensitive than TEE or CTA in detecting intracardiac pathology in NVE or CIED-IE, **18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG PET/CT)** provides increased sensitivity in assessing suspected **PVE** (also **TAVR-PVE**), infection of **ascending aorta grafts**, **extracardiac complications** and **CIED pocket infection**.   
	* As a whole-body image, findings may modify therapy in 25% of NVE and PVE patients.   
	* However, 18FDG-PET/CT is costly, requires preprocedure patient preparation, can have false-positive results in patients with **recent cardiac surgery**, and requires experienced radiographers for interpretation.   
	* The European Society of Cardiology has included findings from these imaging techniques as major criteria in a further modification of the Duke criteria.  
  
---  
  
* In population-based studies and large series (using various diagnostic criteria), IE occurs frequently among patients who have **monomicrobial** bacteremia due to those **gram-positive** organisms that are commonly associated with IE.   
	* 12–17% of patients with blood cultures growing **_E. faecalis_** have IE  
	* 8–14% of patients with blood cultures growing **_S. aureus_** have IE  
	* 7% of patients with blood cultures growing **non-β-hemolytic streptococci** have IE    
* IE risk-prediction scoring systems have been developed to identify patients, among those with one or more positive monomicrobial blood cultures, who are at sufficient risk of IE to justify echocardiographic assessment.

#### Features Guiding the Need for Echocardiographic Assessment in Patients with Selected Monomicrobial Bacteremia  
  
| _S. AUREUS_ | _E. FAECALIS_ | NON-β-HEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI |  
|---|---|---|  
|Intracardiac device | Symptoms ≥7 days | Symptoms ≥7 days|  
|Prior endocarditis | Emboli |Greater than two positive cultures|  
|Injection drug use | Greater than two positive cultures | One species: _S. gallolyticus_, _S. sanguinis_, _S. mutans_ (not _S. anginosus_)|  
|Cerebral/peripheral emboli|Unknown origin (no focus)|Community acquired|  
|Meningitis|Heart murmur|Heart murmur or valve disease|  
|Preexisting valve disease|Valve disease (including prior endocarditis)||  
|Persistent bacteremia (≥72 hours)|||  
|Vertebral osteomyelitis|||  
|Community acquisition|||  
|Non-nosocomial health care associated|||  
|Indeterminate or positive TTE|||  
  
---  
  
* Because _S. aureus_ bacteremia is associated with a high **prevalence** of IE and a resultant high risk for **mortality**, echocardiographic evaluation (high-quality TTE or preferably TEE) is recommended **routinely**.   
	* Prediction scores suggest that with _S. aureus_ bacteremia, a patient with **any** of the features listed in incurs at least a **6%** risk of IE, with risk increasing when multiple features are present.   
	* Thus, when present these findings are a strong indication for early TEE.   
	* In their absence, TTE should suffice unless other findings suggest IE.   
* Among patients with either monomicrobial _E. faecalis_ or non-β-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia, any **three** of the respective listed features are associated with a significant frequency of IE.   
	* For these patients, the estimated number needed to test with TEE to detect IE is 2.4 and 3.6, respectively.   
	* While these predictive scoring systems need further evaluation and should be used with clinical judgment, they appear to have a high sensitivity and therefore a **high negative predictive value**, which allows identification of patients at low risk of IE where echocardiography, particularly TEE, can be **omitted**.

#### The diagnostic use of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography  
  
![[../attachments/hpim21_ch128_f003_1675661150.25793.png| 1200]]  
  
<span style="font-size:medium">  
<sup>†</sup>High initial patient risk for infective endocarditis (IE) or evidence of intracardiac complications (new regurgitant murmur, new electrocardiographic conduction changes, or congestive heart failure).   
<sup>*</sup>High-risk echocardiographic features include large vegetations, valve insufficiency, paravalvular infection, or ventricular dysfunction. Rx indicates initiation of antibiotic therapy. CTA, ECG-gated cardiac CT angiogram; FDG-PET/CT, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography CT.  
</span>  
  
---  
  
## Other Studies  
  
* Many studies that are not diagnostic—i.e., complete blood count, creatinine determination, liver function tests, chest radiography, and electrocardiography—are important in the **management** of patients with IE.   
* The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, rheumatoid factor, and circulating immune complex titer are commonly increased in IE.   
* **CTA**, although exposing patients to radiation and contrast dye, can be used instead of **preoperative cardiac catheterization** to assess coronary artery patency in patients at **low to intermediate risk** of coronary disease.   
* **Brain MRI/MRA** should be obtained in patients with neurologic signs or symptoms, including **unusual headache**, to assess for emboli, hemorrhage, or mycotic aneurysms.   
	* The findings can support the IE diagnosis as well as provide evidence requiring changes in planned **surgical treatment**.   
* Contrast-enhanced whole-body tomography to detect silent emboli in patients without localizing symptoms is **not** likely to enhance diagnostic accuracy and is associated with significant risk of kidney injury due to contrast media exposure.

---  
  
## Antimicrobial Therapy  
  
* To cure IE, all bacteria in the vegetation must be killed.   
	* Difficult because local host defenses are deficient and because the bacteria are largely nongrowing and metabolically inactive and thus are less easily killed by antibiotics   
	* Consequently, therapy must be **bactericidal** and **prolonged**  
* Antibiotics are generally given **parenterally** to achieve serum concentrations that, through passive diffusion, result in effective concentrations in the depths of the vegetation.   
  
---  
  
* The decision to initiate treatment empirically must balance the need to **establish a microbiologic diagnosis** against the potential **disease progression or the need to control infection prior to urgent surgery**.   
* **Infection at other sites (such as the meninges)**, allergies, end-organ dysfunction, interactions with concomitantly administered medications, and risks of adverse events must be considered in the selection of therapy.  
* Recommended antibiotic dosing and duration of therapy is measured **from the time blood cultures become negative**.  
* The regimens recommended for the treatment of PVE are given for several weeks longer.  
  
---  
  
### Streptococci  
  
* The recommended therapies for streptococcal IE are based on the **minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin** for the causative isolate.   
* The 2-week penicillin/gentamicin and ceftriaxone/gentamicin regimens should not be used to treat NVE complicated by cardiac or extracardiac abscess or PVE.   
* Caution should be exercised in considering aminoglycoside-containing regimens in patients at increased risk for aminoglycoside toxicity (renal or eighth cranial nerve).   
* The regimens recommended for relatively penicillin-resistant streptococci are advocated for treatment of group B, C, or G streptococcal IE.   
* _Granulicatella_, _Abiotrophia_, and _Gemella_ species are treated with the regimens for **moderately penicillin-resistant streptococci**, as is **PVE** caused by these organisms or by streptococci with a penicillin MIC of **>0.1 μg/mL**.  
  
---  
  
### Enterococci  
  
* Resistant to **oxacillin, nafcillin, and the cephalosporins**  
* Only **inhibited**—**not killed**—by the cell wall–active agents **penicillin, ampicillin, teicoplanin (not available in the United States), and vancomycin**  
* Killed by the **synergistic interaction** of these cell wall–active antibiotics combined with **gentamicin**, unless the isolate exhibits high-level resistance to gentamicin, defined as growth of the isolate in the presence of gentamicin at **≥500 μg/mL**.   
	* Bactericidal synergy with other aminoglycosides—tobramycin, netilmicin, kanamycin, and amikacin—is **unpredictable** even in the absence of high-level resistance → not used to treat enterococcal IE  
* To reduce potential nephrotoxicity, **penicillin or ampicillin** is the preferred cell wall–active agent for use in combination with gentamicin  
* The dose of gentamicin used to achieve bactericidal synergy in treating enterococcal IE is **smaller** than that used in standard therapy but **nephrotoxicity** is **not uncommon** during treatment lasting 4–6 weeks.   
	* Some experts prefer regimens using gentamicin for only **2–3 weeks**  
  
---  
  
* High concentrations of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, by expanded binding of penicillin-binding proteins, also kill _E. faecalis_ in vitro and in animal models of IE.   
	* Nonrandomized comparative studies: appear comparable and less nephrotoxic than penicillin or ampicillin plus gentamicin for treatment of **_E. faecalis_ (but not _E. faecium_)** IE   
	* May also provide effective treatment when strains possess high-level gentamicin resistance  
	* Has been used increasingly to address not only high-level gentamicin-resistant strains but also to minimize nephrotoxicity  
* The combinations of **vancomycin (or teicoplanin) or gentamicin with ceftriaxone** are not bactericidal for _E. faecalis_ and are not recommended for treatment of enterococcal IE.   
* If a combination regimen cannot be used due to resistance or toxicity, an **8- to 12-week course of a single cell wall–active agent** can be considered.  
	* The patient should be followed carefully for evidence of failure.  
  
---  
  
* Treatment of IE caused by _**E. faecium**_, which is generally more antibiotic resistant than _E. faecalis_ or may be **vancomycin resistant**, is not well established  
	* Successful treatment of IE caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci with **high-dose daptomycin** (**10–12 mg/kg** IV once daily), occasionally **in combination with ampicillin**, has been reported.  
	* If the isolate susceptibility allows treatment with penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin, this is preferred.   
  
---  
  
### Staphylococci  
  
* Management of _S. aureus_ bacteremia and IE in conjunction with infectious disease consultants has been associated with improved outcomes and is recommended.   
* Treatment of staphylococcal IE is based on the presence of a **prosthetic valve or foreign device**, the **native valve(s)** involved (right vs left side), and the **antibiotic susceptibility** of the isolate.   
* Penicillin resistance and, except in specific countries, **methicillin resistance** is widespread among staphylococci.   
	* Thus, empirical therapy for possible staphylococcal IE should use a regimen effective against methicillin-resistant organisms.   
  
---  
  
* Therapy should be revised to a β-lactam agent (preferably an **antistaphylococcal penicillin**) if the isolate is susceptible to methicillin.   
* **Cefazolin** is generally considered an alternative β-lactam agent for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal (MSSA) IE  
	* **Ease of administration** and **reduced adverse events**  
	* Inactivation of cefazolin by **type A and C staphylococcal β-lactamases** (these do not hydrolyze antistaphylococcal penicillins) → treatment failure in **high-inoculum infections**   
	* Initiating treatment with an **antistaphylococcal penicillin** until there is **source control and a reduced inoculum** and then transition to cefazolin is advised.  
* MSSA IE that is **uncomplicated** and limited to the **tricuspid or pulmonic valve** can often be treated with **2 weeks** of oxacillin or nafcillin (but not vancomycin)  
	* Prolonged fever (≥5 days) during therapy or multiple septic pulmonary emboli mandates standard-duration therapy  
  
---  
  
#### MRSA  
  
* For treatment of NVE due to _methicillin-resistant S. aureus_ (MRSA), **vancomycin**, dosed to achieve trough concentrations of at least **15 μg/mL**, (or more precisely an area under the time concentration curve/broth microdilution MIC ratio **(AUC:MIC) >400** achieved with the assistance of a pharmacist) is recommended  
	* The caveat of high vancomycin trough concentrations: associated with nephrotoxicity  
* Although resistance to vancomycin among staphylococci is **rare**, reduced vancomycin susceptibility among MRSA strains is increasingly encountered  
	* Isolates with a vancomycin MIC of **4–8 μg/mL** have intermediate susceptibility and are referred to as **_vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus_ (VISA)**  
	* Isolates with a vancomycin MIC of **2 μg/mL** may harbor subpopulations with higher MICs. These isolates, called **_heteroresistant VISA_ (hVISA)**, are not detectable by routine susceptibility testing and yet may impair vancomycin efficacy.  
  
---  
  
* Daptomycin has provided effective alternative treatment for left-sided NVE caused by documented daptomycin-susceptible MRSA.  
	* FDA approved only for **right-sided IE** at a dose of 6 mg/kg daily  
	* Most recommend doses for treatment of left-sided IE: **8–10 mg/kg** daily  
	* Because receipt of **vancomycin has been associated with emergence of daptomycin nonsusceptibility**, caution should be exercised when switching from vancomycin to daptomycin monotherapy in a patient who has received vancomycin without clearing blood cultures.   
	* Daptomycin activity against MRSA—even against some daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates—is enhanced when given in combination with **nafcillin or ceftaroline**.  
  
---  
  
* Salvage treatment for vancomycin-unresponsive MRSA IE:  
	* High-dose daptomycin combined with nafcillin or ceftaroline, ceftaroline combined with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or ceftaroline alone (600 mg IV q8h) may be effective   
	* Should be considered in patients with **sepsis**, in those with **multifocal sites of infection**, or when bacteremia persists for **4 or more days**.   
	* Eradicable sources of bacteremia should always be addressed; **failure of source control** is a very common reason for persistent MRSA bacteremia.  
  
---  
  
* Right-sided **MRSA** IE is treated for at least **4 weeks** with vancomycin or daptomycin (6 mg/kg daily); 2-week courses of therapy are suboptimal.  
* Staphylococcal **PVE** is treated for **6–8 weeks** with a multidrug regimen.   
	* To achieve long-term bacterial eradication, rifampin, which kills staphylococci embedded in biofilm adherent to foreign material, is an essential component of this regimen.   
	* Rifampin **resistance** can emerge during therapy.   
	* To prevent emergence of resistance, administration of rifampin should be **delayed** until initial therapy with two agents (**gentamicin** plus an antistaphylococcal penicillin or vancomycin selected on the basis of susceptibility testing) has **eradicated** bacteremia (reduced the inoculum).  
	* The isolate’s susceptibility to gentamicin or an alternative agent as well as to rifampin should be established before rifampin treatment is begun.   
	* Possible alternatives for gentamicin include **another aminoglycoside, a fluoroquinolone (chosen on the basis of susceptibility), ceftaroline**, or another active agent.  
  
---  
  
### Other Organisms  
  
* In the absence of meningitis, IE caused by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ isolates with a penicillin MIC of ≤4 μg/mL can be treated with IV penicillin (4 million units IV every 4 h), ceftriaxone (2 g daily as a single dose or cefotaxime at a comparable dose), or vancomycin.   
	* Ceftriaxone or vancomycin is preferred for pneumococcal strains with a penicillin MIC of ≥ 2 μg/mL.   
	* Pneumococcal NVE is treated for 4 weeks and pneumococcal PVE for 6 weeks.   
* **_P. aeruginosa_** IE is treated with an **antipseudomonal cephalosporin** and high doses of **tobramycin** (8 mg/kg per day in three divided doses).   
* IE caused by **_Enterobacterales_** is treated with a **β-lactam antibiotic plus an aminoglycoside**.  
  
---  
  
* **Corynebacterial** IE is treated with **penicillin plus an aminoglycoside** (if the organism is susceptible to the aminoglycoside) or with **vancomycin**, which is highly bactericidal for most strains.   
* Therapy for **_Candida_** IE consists of a lipid formulation of **amphotericin B (3–5 mg/kg IV daily)** with or without flucytosine (25 mg/kg PO q6h; monitor **renal and bone marrow** function).   
	* Alternatively, a high-dose echinocandin regimen can be used.   
	* **Valve dysfunction or PVE**: **early surgery** and long-term (if not indefinite) **oral azole suppression**  
	* No valve dysfunction: medical treatment with long-term oral azole suppression may achieve results comparable to surgical treatment  
  
---  
  
### EMPIRICAL THERAPY AND TREATMENT FOR CULTURE-NEGATIVE IE  
  
* **Clinical clues** to etiology (e.g., acute vs subacute presentation, NVE, early or late PVE, the patient’s predispositions) as well as **epidemiologic clues** (region of residence, animal exposure) must be considered  
	* Acute IE: should cover MRSA  
	* PWID or health care–associated NVE: cover antibiotic-resistant GNB  
* Treatment with **vancomycin plus gentamicin or cefepime**, initiated immediately after blood cultures are obtained, covers these organisms as well as many others.   
* For empirical treatment of NVE with a subacute presentation, **vancomycin plus ceftriaxone** is reasonable.   
* For blood culture–pending PVE, **vancomycin, gentamicin, and cefepime** should be used if the prosthetic valve has been in place for **≤1 year**.   
* Empirical therapy for late PVE (valve in place for >1 year) is similar to that for culture-negative NVE.   
* ==**Therapy is revised once a pathogen has been identified.**==  
  
---  
  
* In the treatment of blood culture–negative episodes, marantic endocarditis and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome must be considered.   
* In the absence of **prior antibiotic therapy**, it is unlikely that infection due to _S. aureus_, CoNS, enterococci, or _Enterobacterales_ will present with negative blood cultures; thus recommended empirical therapy targets **fastidious streptococci, _Abiotrophia_, _Granulicatella_, the HACEK group, and _Bartonella_ species**.   
	* Pending the availability of diagnostic data, blood culture–negative subacute NVE is treated with **vancomycin plus ampicillin-sulbactam or ceftriaxone**  
	* Doxycycline is added for enhanced _Bartonella_ coverage   
* If cultures are negative because of prior antibiotic administration, pathogens **likely to be inhibited** by the specific prior therapy should be considered.  
  
---  
  
### TAVR-PVE  
  
* The vast majority of these patients are treated medically with classic PVE antibiotic regimens for the given pathogen.   
* Selection of empirical therapy pending blood culture results similarly parallels that for classic PVE but with recognition that **enterococcal infection** occurs with increased frequency.  
  
---  
  
### CIED-IE  
  
* Antimicrobial therapy for CIED IE (as well as for generator pocket and lead infection) is adjunctive to **complete removal of the device**.   
* The antimicrobial selected is based on the causative organism and should be used as recommended for NVE.   
* Bacteremic CIED infection may be complicated by coincident left-sided NVE, PVE, or remote-site infection (e.g., osteomyelitis), which may require modification of antimicrobial therapy.   
* A 4- to 6-week course of IE-targeted therapy is recommended for patients with CIED-IE and for those with bacteremia that continues after device removal.   
  
---  
  
* In the absence of another source, ==***S. aureus bacteremia***== (and ==**persistent CoNS bacteremia**==) is likely indicative of CIED-IE or valvular IE and should be investigated and managed accordingly.   
* Not all bloodstream infections in these patients indicate IE.   
	* If evidence suggesting CIED-IE is lacking, bloodstream infection due to gram-negative bacilli, streptococci, and enterococci species may not indicate CIED-IE and can be treated with antimicrobial therapy for the alternative diagnosis.   
	* However, in these patients **relapse after antimicrobial therapy** increases the likelihood of CIED-IE and warrants treatment as such.   
* Attempted salvage of an infected CIED with antibiotics alone and long-term suppressive therapy is **usually unsuccessful** and should be reserved for patients whose devices cannot be removed or who refuse removal. Careful follow-up is required.  
  
---  
  
### PARTIAL ORAL ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT OF IE  
  
* A noninferiority, multicenter, randomized study found mortality among patients with **left-sided IE** caused by **streptococci, enterococci, and staphylococci** who received partial oral treatment comparable to that of patients who were treated intravenously for the full course of therapy (6.5% and 7.5%, respectively).   
	* Four hundred **clinically stable** patients (20% of the population screened) who had received at least **10 days** of parenteral therapy (or at least 7 days after surgery) were enrolled.   
	* IE was caused by **streptococci (49%)**, enterococci (24%), and MSSA (22%); **no patients had MRSA**.   
	* Of note, the median duration of intravenous treatment before the switch to oral agents was **16 days (interquartile range, 13–23)**; thus, some patients may have been **effectively cured** by intravenous therapy with or without surgery prior to transition to oral therapy.   
	* The results in this highly selected and monitored cohort with relatively small numbers of patients with enterococcal and _S. aureus_ IE may not be generalizable to most patients with IE → **caution is advised before adopting this approach as standard care**  
  
---  
  
### MONITORING ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY  
  
* Antibiotic-related adverse events occur in **25–40%** of IE patients and commonly arise after several weeks of therapy.   
* Blood tests to detect **renal, hepatic, and hematologic** toxicity should be performed periodically.   
* **Serum concentrations** of aminoglycosides and vancomycin should be monitored and doses adjusted to optimize treatment and minimize toxicity.  
* Control of peripheral sites of infection—**source control**—should be addressed promptly.  
* Vegetations become smaller with effective therapy; however, 3 months after cure, **50% are unchanged**, and 25% each are slightly larger or smaller.  
  
---  
  
* **Blood cultures should be repeated daily until sterile** in patients with IE due to **_S. aureus_ or difficult-to-treat organisms**, rechecked if there is **recrudescent fever**, and performed again **4–6 weeks after therapy** to document cure.   
	* Blood cultures become sterile after 2 days of appropriate therapy when infection is caused by viridans streptococci, _E. faecalis_, or HACEK organisms.   
	* In MSSA IE, β-lactam therapy results in sterile cultures in **3–5 days**  
	* In MRSA IE, the duration of bacteremia is often longer with vancomycin or daptomycin treatment.   
		* MRSA bacteremia persisting despite an appropriate dosage of vancomycin or daptomycin may indicate **emergence of reduced susceptibility** in the infecting strain and point to a need for **alternative therapy**.   
		* When fever persists for **7 days** despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, patients should be evaluated further for **paravalvular abscess, extracardiac abscesses (spleen, kidney), or complications (embolic events)**.   
		* Recrudescent fever raises the possibility of these complications but also of **drug reactions or complications of hospitalization**.   
  
---  
  
## Surgical Treatment  
  
* Surgery Required for Optimal Outcome  
	* Native-valve or prosthetic-valve endocarditis  
		* Moderate or severe congestive heart failure or shock due to valve dysfunction  
		* Paravalvular extension of infection with abscess, fistula, or heart block  
		* Persistent bacteremia without an extracardiac cause despite 7–10 days of optimal antimicrobial therapy  
		* Lack of effective antimicrobial therapy (e.g., fungal, Brucella, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacillary endocarditis)  
	* Prosthetic-valve endocarditis  
		* Partially dehisced unstable prosthetic valve  
		* Paravalvular extension of infection with abscess, fistula, or heart block  
  
---  
  
* Surgery To Be Strongly Considered for Improved Outcome (multiple findings are often combined to justify surgery)  
	* Prosthetic-valve endocarditis  
		* *S. aureus* infection with intracardiac complications  
		* Relapse after optimal antimicrobial therapy  
	* Native-valve endocarditis  
		* Large (>10-mm) hypermobile vegetation, particularly with prior systemic embolus and significant valve dysfunction (in the group with an estimated low cardiac-surgery mortality risk  
		* Very large (>30-mm) vegetation  
		* Persistent unexplained fever (≥10 days) in blood culture–negative endocarditis  
		* Poorly responsive or relapsed endocarditis due to highly antibiotic-resistant enterococci or gram-negative bacilli  
  
---  
  
* Between **25% and 40%** of patients with left-sided IE undergo cardiac surgery during active infection, with slightly higher surgery rates for **PVE** than NVE.   
* The benefit of surgery has been assessed primarily in retrospective studies comparing populations of medically and surgically treated patients **matched** for the necessity of surgery, with adjustments for predictors of death (comorbidities) and the timing of surgical intervention (a correction for survival bias).   
	* Although study results vary, surgery for NVE based on current indications appears to convey a **significant survival benefit (27–55%)**, which is greatest among those with the most pressing indications.   
		* The survival benefit becomes more apparent after ≥6 months.   
	* The effect of surgery for PVE is more nuanced, with survival benefits accruing largely to those with **intracardiac complications**.   
		* Of note, **surgery itself carries mortality risks** that may offset survival benefits in patients with lesser indications.   
		* Among patients with TAVR-PVE, 50–80% are reported to have an indication for surgical intervention—yet because of high pre-TAVR estimated operative mortality, **<15%** undergo surgery.   
		* Some patients with significant aortic regurgitation after medical cure of infection have undergone valve-in-valve redo-TAVR.  
  
---  
  
### INDICATIONS  
  
---  
  
#### Congestive Heart Failure  
  
* Moderate to severe refractory CHF caused by new or worsening valve dysfunction or intracardiac fistulae is the major indication for cardiac surgery.   
* Surgery can relieve functional stenosis due to large vegetations or restore competence to damaged regurgitant valves by repair or replacement.   
* At 6–12 months of follow-up of patients with left-sided NVE or PVE and moderate to severe CHF due to valve dysfunction, survival is significantly improved among those treated surgically compared with those treated medically.   
* The survival benefit with surgery is inversely related to the severity of preoperative CHF; thus surgery should not be delayed in the face of deteriorating hemodynamics.  
  
---  
  
#### Paravalvular Infection  
  
* This complication, which is most common with **aortic valve infection**, occurs in 10–15% of patients with NVE and in 45–60% of those with PVE.   
* It is suggested clinically by **persistent unexplained fever during appropriate therapy, new electrocardiographic conduction disturbances, or pericarditis**.   
* For optimal outcome, paravalvular infection requires surgery, especially when **fever persists, fistulae develop, prostheses are dehisced and unstable, or infection relapses after appropriate treatment**.   
* Cardiac rhythm must be monitored since high-grade heart block may require insertion of a pacemaker.  
  
---  
  
#### Uncontrolled Infection  
  
* Continued positive blood cultures or otherwise unexplained persistent fevers despite optimal antibiotic therapy may reflect uncontrolled infection that warrants surgery.   
* Surgical treatment is also advised for IE caused by organisms against which effective antimicrobial therapy is lacking (e.g., **yeasts, molds, _P. aeruginosa_, other highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria, _Brucella_ species**).  
  
---  
  
#### _S. aureus_ IE  
  
* The mortality rate for _S. aureus_ PVE **exceeds 50%** with medical treatment and may be reduced with surgical treatment.   
* Nevertheless, surgery is not routinely advised for uncomplicated _S. aureus_ PVE.   
	* Rather, survival benefits are most likely in those with **paravalvular infection, dysfunctional valves, and CHF**.   
* Surgical treatment of _S. aureus_ NVE should be guided by the standard indications.   
	* Isolated tricuspid-valve _S. aureus_ IE, even with persistent fever, rarely requires surgery.  
  
---  
  
#### Prevention of Systemic Emboli  
  
* Persisting morbidity and/or death may result from **cerebral or coronary artery emboli**.  
	* Antithrombotic therapy does not prevent systemic emboli in NVE.   
* The frequency of embolization decreases rapidly with effective antimicrobial therapy.   
	* Thus, if emboli are to be prevented through surgical intervention, surgery must occur **very early**.   
* Vegetation characteristics defined echocardiographically can identify patients at high risk of embolization but do not identify those patients in whom surgery to prevent emboli will increase survival.   
	* In a small randomized trial in patients who were at low risk of surgery-related mortality and had large vegetations (>10 mm) and significant valve dysfunction, emboli were prevented by early surgery (**≤48 h** after diagnosis), but there was no survival benefit.   
	* Rarely is prevention of emboli the sole indication for surgery; more often this may be an additional benefit of early surgery for other indications.   
	* **Valve repair**, with the consequent **avoidance of a prosthesis**, improves the benefit-to-risk ratio of surgery performed to eliminate vegetations.  
  
---  
  
#### CIED-IE  
  
* **Removal of all hardware** is recommended for patients with established CIED-IE as well as for pocket or intracardiac lead infection.   
* Percutaneous lead extraction is preferred; if hardware remains after attempted percutaneous extraction, surgical removal should be considered.   
* With lead vegetations >2 cm, there is a risk of a pulmonary embolism; nevertheless, the need for CIED removal surgically is unclear.   
* Removal of the infected CIED during the initial hospitalization is associated with increased 30-day and 1-year survival rates over those attained with antibiotic therapy and device retention.   
* The CIED, if needed, can be reimplanted at a new site after at least **10–14 days** of effective antimicrobial therapy.   
* CIEDs should be replaced when patients undergo surgery for IE.

* With life-threatening indications for surgery (valve dysfunction and severe CHF, perivalvular abscess, major prosthesis dehiscence), surgery during the initial days of therapy is associated with greater survival than later surgery.   
* With less compelling indications, surgery may reasonably be delayed to allow further treatment as well as improvement in overall health.   
* Neurologic complications of IE may be exacerbated during cardiac surgery.   
	* The risk of neurologic deterioration is related to the type and severity of the preoperative neurologic complication and the interval between the complication and surgery.   
	* Non-urgent cardiac surgery should be delayed for **2–3 weeks** after a large nonhemorrhagic embolic infarction and for **4 weeks** after a significant cerebral hemorrhage.   
	* A ruptured mycotic aneurysm should be treated before cardiac surgery.   
	* In a non-obtunded patient with an ischemic stroke and hemorrhage excluded by imaging, cardiac surgery, if urgent, should be performed early.

### ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY  
  
* Organisms have been detected on Gram stain—or their DNA has been detected by PCR—in excised valves from 45% of patients who have completed the recommended therapy for IE.   
* However, organisms, most of which are unusual or antibiotic resistant, are rarely cultured from these valves.   
* Detection of organisms or their DNA does not necessarily indicate antibiotic failure; in fact, **relapse after surgery for active IE is uncommon**.   
* Thus, in uncomplicated NVE caused by susceptible organisms, the duration of preoperative plus postoperative treatment should equal the total duration of recommended therapy.   
* For IE complicated by perivalvular abscess, partially treated PVE, or valves culture-positive for the original organism, a **full course** of therapy should be given postoperatively.

### TREATMENT OF IE IN PWID  
  
* PWID should be treated according to the standard guidelines for antibiotic selection and surgical intervention.   
* Additionally, **opiate use disorder (OUD)** must be recognized as an ongoing predisposition for IE and treated; this includes medication-assisted therapy that is initiated during hospitalization and continued without delay upon discharge.   
* Addressing OUD significantly increases completion of antibiotic therapy, decreases resumption of injection drug use, and decreases recurrent IE and requirement for cardiac surgery.  
  
---  
  
### EXTRACARDIAC COMPLICATIONS  
  
* **Splenic abscess** develops in 3–5% of patients with IE.   
	* Effective therapy requires either image-guided percutaneous drainage or splenectomy.   
* **Mycotic aneurysms** occur in 2–15% of IE patients  
	* One-half of these cases involve the cerebral arteries and present as headaches, focal neurologic symptoms, or hemorrhage.   
	* Cerebral aneurysms should be monitored by angiography.   
	* Some will resolve with effective antimicrobial therapy, but those that have leaked or persist or enlarge should be treated surgically, if possible.   
	* Extracerebral aneurysms present as **local pain, a mass, local ischemia, or bleeding**; these are treated surgically.

# Outcome  
  
* IE is a heterogeneous disease that occurs in extremely heterogeneous patient populations.   
* Adverse outcomes are associated with:   
	* older age  
	* severe comorbid conditions and diabetes  
	* delayed diagnosis  
	* involvement of prosthetic valves or the aortic valve  
	* an invasive (_S. aureus_) or antibiotic-resistant (_P. aeruginosa_, yeast) pathogen  
	* intracardiac and major neurologic complications, and health–care associated infection   
* Death or poor outcome often is related not to failure of antibiotic therapy but rather to the interactions of comorbidities and IE-related end-organ complications.   
  
---  
  
* In developed countries, overall survival rates are **80–85%**.  
* Rates vary considerably among subpopulations of IE patients.  
	* The outcome for a given patient depends on that individual’s infection, the complexity of required therapy, and preexisting comorbidities.   
	* About 85–90% of patients with NVE caused by viridans streptococci, HACEK organisms, or enterococci (susceptible to synergistic therapy) survive.   
	* For _S. aureus_ NVE in patients who do not inject drugs, survival rates are **55–70%**; rates are **85–90%** among PWID.   
		* 1-year mortality rises to **20–30%** among PWID if addiction is not successfully addressed.   
	* PVE beginning within 2 months after valve replacement results in mortality rates of **40–50%**, whereas rates are only **10–20%** in late-onset cases.   
	* In the elderly population with TAVR-PVE the in-hospital mortality is **35–50%** and increases to **60–75%** at 1 year.   
	* Crude survival rates after successful treatment of IE generally are **80–90%** and **70–80%** at 1 and 2 years, respectively.

# Prevention  
  
* Prevention of IE has been a goal of clinical practice; however, the evidence establishing benefit from _antibiotic prophylaxis for IE_ is insufficient to recommend it as a widespread standard of care.   
* The American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology recommend limiting prophylactic antibiotics to only patients **at highest risk** for severe morbidity or death from IE.   
* The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom initially advised discontinuation of all antibiotic prophylaxis for IE but recently became less dogmatic, allowing clinicians to use clinical judgment in the settings outlined.

### High-Risk Cardiac Lesions for Which Endocarditis Prophylaxis is Advised Before Dental Procedures  
  
* Prosthetic heart valves or material  
* Left ventricular assist devices or implantable heart  
* Prior endocarditis  
* Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, including palliative shunts or conduits  
* Completely repaired congenital heart defects during the 6 months after repair  
* Repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects adjacent to prosthetic material  
* Surgical or transcatheter pulmonary artery valve or conduit placement  
* Valvulopathy developing after cardiac transplantation (not endorsed by ESC)

### Antibiotic Regimens for Prophylaxis of Endocarditis in Adults with High-Risk Cardiac Lesions  
  
* Standard oral regimen  
	* **Amoxicillin**: 2 g PO 1 h before procedure  
* Inability to take oral medication  
	* **Ampicillin**: 2 g IV or IM within 1 h before procedure  
* Penicillin allergy  
	* **Clarithromycin or azithromycin**: 500 mg PO 1 h before procedure  
	* **Cephalexin**: 2 g PO 1 h before procedure  
	* **Doxycycline**: 100 mg PO 1 h before procedure  
* Penicillin allergy, inability to take oral medication  
	* **Cefazolin or ceftriaxone**: 1 g IV or IM 30 min before procedure  
* Do not use cephalosporins in patients with **immediate hypersensitivity (urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis)** to penicillin.  
  
---  
  
* In at-risk patients, maintaining **good dental hygiene** is recommended  
* Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended only when:  
	* there is **manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of the teeth**    
	* perforation of the oral mucosa (including with respiratory tract surgery).  
* Severe adverse events related to amoxicillin prophylaxis are exceedingly rare  
* Clindamycin prophylaxis has been associated with low but significant rates of fatal and nonfatal adverse reactions with **_Clostridioides difficile_ infection**.   
	* The American Heart Association now recommends against the use of clindamycin for prophylaxis.   
* Prophylaxis is not advised for patients undergoing gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract procedures  
* **Genitourinary tract infections (or skin infection)** should be treated before or when these sites **undergo procedures**.  
* In patients with aortic or mitral valve regurgitation or a prosthetic valve, treatment of acute Q fever for **12 months** with doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine is highly effective in preventing _C. burnetii_ IE.
