# Legionella  
## When to suspect _Legionella_  
  
_Legionella_ infection should be considered in any patient presenting with pneumonia. While the majority of _Legionella_ infections occur sporadically in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), infection can also be acquired in health care settings.  
  
The index of suspicion for _Legionella_ infection should be particularly high during known **_outbreaks_**, which are often associated with contamination of water supplies in large facilities such as hospitals, hotels, or apartment buildings. Other epidemiologic factors that should heighten suspicion for _Legionella_ infection include **_season_**, known or potential exposure to a contaminated water source (eg, hot tubs, birthing pools, fountains), **_travel_**, and exposure to soil or potting mix in areas where the incidence of _L. longbeachae_ is high.  
  
- Patient risk factors include older age, smoking, and chronic lung, cardiovascular, or renal disease. Immunocompromise, particularly impaired cell-mediated immunity, increases both the likelihood of infection and poorer outcome.   
- **Failure to respond to beta-lactam monotherapy** in a patient with pneumonia should also raise suspicion for _Legionella_ infection.   
- Concern may also be raised when **the course of a viral infection follows an unexpected course**. Fatal cases of coinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been reported but these are rare and the association is unclear.  
- Although certain clinical features (eg, **altered mental status**, **gastrointestinal symptoms**, and **hyponatremia**) might raise suspicion for _Legionella_ infection, no individual symptom or sign or combination is pathognomic. Laboratory testing is necessary for diagnosis.  
  
## Whom to test  
  
Because early diagnosis and administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is associated with improved outcomes in patients with Legionnaires' disease, we take an inclusive approach to diagnosis and generally test the following patients:  
  
- All patients with moderate to severe CAP or patients with CAP who require hospitalization  
- Any patient with CAP or nosocomial pneumonia who has a known or possible exposure to _Legionella_ (eg, during an outbreak)  
- Immunocompromised patients (who are at higher risk for _Legionella_ infection and severe disease)  
  
Our approach is largely consistent with recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Each organization recommends testing for _Legionella_ infection in all patients with severe CAP or those who require hospitalization. In addition, IDSA/ATS and BTS guidelines recommend testing for patients with nonsevere CAP who have specific risk factors or epidemiologic exposures.
