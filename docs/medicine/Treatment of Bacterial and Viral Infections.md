* Multiple essential components of bacterial cell structures and metabolism have been the targets of antibacterial agents used in clinical medicine  
	* In general, targets have been chosen because they either **do not exist** in mammalian cells and physiology or are **sufficiently different** from their bacterial counterparts to allow selective bacterial targeting.   
* The interaction of an agent with its target results in either inhibition of bacterial growth and replication (==**bacteriostatic effect**==) or bacterial killing (==**bactericidal effect**==).   
* Treatment with bacteriostatic agents is effective when the patient’s **host defenses** are sufficient to contribute to eradication of the infecting pathogen.   
* In patients with **impaired host defenses** (e.g., neutropenia) or infections at **body sites with impaired or limited host defenses (e.g., meningitis and endocarditis)**, ==**bactericidal**== agents are generally preferred.  
  
---  
  
### INHIBITION OF CELL WALL SYNTHESIS  
  
* The bacterial cell wall, which is external to the cytoplasmic membrane and has **no counterpart in mammalian cells**, protects bacterial cells from **lysis** under low osmotic conditions.   
	* The cell wall is a cross-linked peptidoglycan composed of a polymer of alternating units of **_N_-acetylglucosamine (NAG)** and **_N_-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)**, four-amino-acid stem peptides linked to each NAM, and a peptide cross-bridge that links adjacent stem peptides to form a netlike structure.  
* Several steps in **peptidoglycan synthesis** are targets of antibacterial agents.   
	* Inhibition of cell wall synthesis generally results in a **bactericidal** effect that is linked to cell lysis  
  
---  
  
* In gram-positive bacteria the peptidoglycan is the most external cell structure  
* In gram-negative bacteria, an **asymmetric lipid outer membrane** is external to the peptidoglycan and contains diffusion channels called **_porins_**.   
	* The space between the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan and cytoplasmic membrane is referred to as the **_periplasmic space_**.   
	* Most antibacterial drugs enter the gram-negative bacterial cell through a **porin channel**, since the outer membrane is a major **diffusion barrier**.   
* Although the peptidoglycan layer is thicker in gram-positive (20–80 nm) than in gram-negative (1 nm) bacteria, peptidoglycan itself constitutes only a limited diffusion barrier for antibacterial agents.  
  
---  
  
#### β-Lactams  
  
* Include penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems  
* Target **transpeptidase enzymes** (also called ***penicillin-binding proteins or PBPs***) involved in the stem-peptide cross-linking step   
* **Inhibitors of β-lactamases**—bacterial enzymes that can degrade β-lactams—are used in combination with some β-lactams to expand their spectrum of activity.  
  
---  
  
#### Glycopeptides  
  
* Including **vancomycin** and **teicoplanin**  
* Bind the two **terminal D-alanine residues** of the stem peptide, hindering the glycosyltransferase involved in polymerizing NAG–NAM units as well as transpeptidases.   
	* Vancomycin also binds to the lipid II intermediate that delivers cell wall precursor subunits.   
	* The additional binding of teicoplanin to the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane contributes to their **increased potency**.   
  
---  
  
#### Fosfomycin  
  
* Interrupt enzymatic steps in the production of peptidoglycan precursors in the **cytoplasm**  
  
---  
  
### INHIBITION OF PROTEIN SYNTHESIS  
  
* Most inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis target bacterial **ribosomes**, whose difference from eukaryotic ribosomes allows selective antibacterial action.   
* Some inhibitors bind to the **30S** ribosomal subunit and others to the **50S** subunit.   
* Most protein synthesis–inhibiting agents are **bacteriostatic**  
	* Aminoglycosides are an exception and are **bactericidal**  
  
---  
  
![[../attachments/abx_ribosome2.png| 1200]]  
  
---  
%%  
#### Aminoglycosides  
  
* Aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, netilmicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, and plazomicin) bind irreversibly to **16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)** of the **30S** ribosomal subunit  
	* Block the translocation of **peptidyl transfer RNA (tRNA)** from the A (aminoacyl) to the P (peptidyl) site  
* Low concentrations: cause misreading of messenger RNA (mRNA) codons and thus the introduction of incorrect amino acids into the peptide chain  
* Higher concentrations: translocation of the peptide chain is blocked  
* Cellular uptake of aminoglycosides is dependent on the **electrochemical gradient** across the bacterial membrane.   
	* Under **anaerobic** conditions, this gradient is reduced, with a consequent reduction in the uptake and activity of the aminoglycosides.   
  
---  
  
#### Tetracyclines  
  
* Tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline) bind reversibly to the **16S rRNA** of the **30S** ribosomal subunit and block the binding of aminoacyl tRNA to the ribosomal A site, thereby inhibiting peptide elongation.   
* **Active transport** of tetracyclines into bacterial but not mammalian cells contributes to the selectivity of these agents.   
* Tigecycline, a derivative of minocycline and the only available glycylcycline, acts similarly to the tetracyclines but is distinctive for its ability to circumvent the most common mechanisms of **resistance** to the tetracyclines.   
* Other new tetracycline—eravacycline, a fluorocycline, and omadacycline, an aminomethylcycline—like tigecycline are notable for being little affected by prior common tetracycline resistance mechanisms.  
  
---  
  
#### Macrolides and Ketolides  
  
* In contrast to the aminoglycosides and tetracyclines, the macrolides (azithromycin), clarithromycin, and erythromycin) and ketolides (telithromycin) bind to the **23S rRNA** of the **50S** ribosomal subunit.   
* These agents block translocation of the growing peptide chain by binding to the tunnel from which the chain exits the ribosome.  
  
---  
  
#### Lincosamides  
  
* **Clindamycin** is the only lincosamide in clinical use.   
* It binds to the **23S rRNA** of the **50S** ribosomal subunit, interacting with both the ribosomal A and P sites and blocking peptide bond formation.  
  
---  
  
#### Oxazolidinones  
  
* **Linezolid** and tedizolid are the only oxazolidinones in clinical use.   
* They bind directly to the A site in the **23S rRNA** of the **50S** ribosomal subunit and block binding of aminoacyl tRNA, inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis.  
  
---  
%%  
### INHIBITION OF BACTERIAL METABOLISM  
  
* Available inhibitors (antimetabolites) target the pathway for **synthesis of folate**, which is a cofactor in a number of one-carbon transfer reactions involved in the synthesis of some nucleic acids, including the pyrimidine **thymidine and all purines (adenine and guanine)**, as well as some amino acids (methionine and serine) and acetyl coenzyme A.   
* The selective antibacterial effect stems from the **inability of mammalian cells to synthesize folate**; they depend instead on exogenous sources.   
* Antibacterial activity may be reduced in the presence of **high exogenous concentrations of the end products of the folate pathway** (e.g., thymidine and purines) that may occur in some infections, resulting from **local breakdown of leukocytes and host tissues**.  
  
---  
  
![[../attachments/Folic-acid-synthesis-inhibitors.webp| 1200]]  
  
---  
  
%%  
  
#### Sulfonamides  
  
* Sulfonamides, including sulfadiazine, sulfisoxazole, and sulfamethoxazole, inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS), which adds _p_-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to pteridine, producing dihydropteroate.   
* Sulfonamides are structural analogues of PABA and act as competing enzyme substrates.  
  
---  
  
#### Trimethoprim  
  
* Subsequent steps in folate synthesis are catalyzed by dihydrofolate synthase, which adds glutamate to dihydropteroate, and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which then generates the final product, tetrahydrofolate.   
* Trimethoprim is a structural analogue of pteridine and inhibits DHFR.   
* Trimethoprim is available alone but is most often used in combination products that also contain sulfamethoxazole and thus block two sequential steps in folate synthesis.  
  
---  
%%  
  
### INHIBITION OF DNA AND RNA SYNTHESIS OR ACTIVITY  
  
---  
  
#### Quinolones  
  
* The first agent in the class: nalidixic acid  
* Fluorinated derivatives (fluoroquinolones): norfloxacin, **ciprofloxacin**, levofloxacin, **moxifloxacin**, **gemifloxacin**, and delafloxacin  
* Interact with **DNA gyrase** and **DNA topoisomerase IV**, which alter DNA topology → trap enzyme–DNA complexes → block movement of the DNA replication apparatus → lethal double-strand breaks in DNA → **bactericidal** activity  
	* The structures of the mammalian enzymes are sufficiently different from those of the bacterial enzymes that quinolones have substantially selective antibacterial activity.  
  
---  
  
#### Rifamycins  
  
* Rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine are semisynthetic derivatives of **rifamycin B**  
* Bind the β subunit of bacterial **RNA polymerase**, thereby blocking elongation of mRNA.   
* Their action is highly selective for the bacterial enzyme over mammalian RNA polymerases.  
  
---  
  
#### Metronidazole  
  
* Metronidazole is a synthetic nitroimidazole with activity limited to **anaerobic bacteria** and certain **anaerobic protozoa**.   
* Reduction of its nitro group by the **electron-transport system** in anaerobic bacteria produces reactive intermediates that damage DNA and result in **bactericidal** activity.   
* Selective antibacterial activity because the reducing activity needed to produce active derivatives is generated only by bacterial and not mammalian enzymes.  
  
---  
  
### DISRUPTION OF MEMBRANE INTEGRITY  
  
* The integrity of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane—and, in gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane—is important for bacterial viability.   
* Two **bactericidal** drugs have membrane targets.  
  
---  
  
#### Polymyxins  
  
* Polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin)  
* **Cationic** cyclic polypeptides that disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane and the outer membrane (the latter by binding **lipopolysaccharide**, which is **negatively** charged).  
  
---  
  
#### Daptomycin  
  
* A lipopeptide that binds the cytoplasmic membrane of gram-positive bacteria in the presence of **calcium** → generate a channel that leads to leakage of cytoplasmic **potassium ions** and **membrane depolarization**.

## Approach to Therapy  
  
* The approach to antibiotic therapy is driven by **host factors, site of infection, and local resistance profiles** of suspected or known pathogens.   
* Further, national and local drug shortages and formulary restrictions can affect available therapies.   
* Regular monitoring of the patient and collection of laboratory data should be undertaken to streamline antibacterial therapy as appropriate and to investigate the possibility of treatment failure if the patient fails to respond appropriately.  
  
---  
  
### EMPIRICAL AND DIRECTED THERAPY  
  
![[../attachments/brun14_ch56_f001_1660822594.47992.png| 1200]]  
  
---  
  
* Therapy is considered **_empirical_** when the causative agent has **yet to be determined** and therapeutic decisions are based on the severity of illness, the clinician’s assessment of likely pathogens in light of the clinical syndrome, the patient’s medical conditions and prior therapy, and relevant epidemiologic factors.   
	* For patients with severe illness, empirical therapy often takes the form of an antibacterial combination that provides **broad coverage** of diverse agents and thus ensures adequate treatment of possible pathogens while additional data are being collected.   
* Information on **epidemiology**, **exposures**, and **local antibacterial susceptibility patterns** can help guide empirical therapy.   
  
---  
  
* When empirical treatment is clinically appropriate, care should be taken to obtain clinical specimens for microbiologic analysis before the initiation of therapy and to adjust therapy as new information is obtained about the patient’s clinical condition and the causal pathogens.   
* **_Directed_** therapy is predicated on **identification** of the pathogen, determination of its **susceptibility** profile, and establishment of the **extent of the infection**.   
	* Directed therapy generally allows the use of more targeted and **narrower-spectrum** antibacterial agents than does empirical therapy.  
* Change to directed therapy can limit unnecessary risks of **drug side effects** as well as **selection for antibacterial resistance**.  
  
---  
  
### SITE OF INFECTION  
  
* The site of infection is a consideration in antibacterial therapy, largely because of the differing abilities of drugs to **penetrate** and achieve adequate **concentrations** at particular body sites.   
* For example, to be effective in the treatment of meningitis, an agent must (1) be able to cross the **blood-brain barrier** and reach adequate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and (2) be active against the relevant pathogen(s).   
	* **Dexamethasone**, administered with or 15–20 min before the first dose of an antibacterial drug, has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with some types of **acute bacterial meningitis**, but its use may **reduce penetration** of some antibacterial agents, such as **vancomycin**, into the CSF.   
	* In this case, **rifampin** is added because its penetration is not reduced by dexamethasone.   
  
---  
  
* Infections at sites where pathogens are **protected from normal host defenses, penetration of an antibacterial drug is limited, or local conditions (e.g., low pH)** limit activity of some agents include, in addition to meningitis, **osteomyelitis, prostatitis, intraocular infections, and abscesses**.   
	* Consideration must be given to the route of drug delivery (e.g., **intravitreal** injections) as well as to interventions to **drain**, **debride**, or otherwise reduce bacterial load and necrotic material that can reduce antibacterial activity.  
  
---  
  
### HOST FACTORS  
  
* Host factors, including immune function, pregnancy, allergies, age, renal and hepatic function, drug–drug interactions, comorbid conditions, and occupational or social exposures, should be considered.  
  
---  
  
#### Immune Dysfunction  
  
* Patients with deficits in immune function that blunt the response to bacterial infection, including **neutropenia, deficient humoral immunity, and asplenia (either surgical or functional)**, are all at increased risk of severe bacterial infection.   
	* Such patients should be treated aggressively and often broadly in the early stages of suspected infection pending results of microbiologic tests.   
* For asplenic patients, treatment should include coverage of **encapsulated organisms**, particularly _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, that may cause rapidly life-threatening infection.   
* For **neutropenic** patients, initial treatment typically includes antibacterial agents with broad activity against gram-negative bacteria.  
  
---  
  
#### Pregnancy  
  
* Pregnancy affects decisions regarding antibacterial therapy in two respects.   
	* Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of particular infections (e.g., those caused by **_Listeria_**).   
	* The potential risks to the fetus that are posed by specific drugs must be considered.   
* Drugs submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval **after 2015** do not use the pregnancy risk categories.   
  
---  
  
* The safety of the vast majority of antibacterial agents in pregnancy has not been established → grouped in categories B and C by the FDA   
	+ Category B: Either animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; _or_ animal studies have shown an adverse effect, but adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in any trimester.   
	+ Category C: **Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus**, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.   
+ Drugs in categories D and X are **contraindicated** in pregnancy or lactation due to **established risks**.   
	 Category D: There is **positive evidence of human fetal risk** based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.

#### Allergies  
  
* Allergies to antibiotics are among the most common allergies reported, and an allergy history should be obtained whenever possible before therapy is chosen.   
* A detailed allergy history can shed light on the type of reaction experienced previously and on whether rechallenge with the same or a related medication is advisable (and, if so, under what circumstances).   
* Allergies to the **penicillins** are most common.   
	* Although as many as **10%** of patients may report an allergy to penicillin, studies suggest that **more than 90%** of these patients could tolerate a penicillin or cephalosporin.   
* **Adverse effects** should be distinguished from true allergies to ensure appropriate selection of antibacterial therapy.

#### Common Adverse Reactions to Antibacterial Agents  
  
|ANTIBACTERIAL(S)|POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS|COMMENTS|  
|---|---|---|  
|β-Lactams|Hypersensitivity reactions|Range from rash to anaphylaxis. Cross-reactivity among β-lactams is related to chemical structure and side chain similarity.|  
||**Neurotoxicity**|More commonly described with **cefepime** and **imipenem**, but likely a class effect. Risk is increased in patients with history of seizures, renal impairment, and advanced age.|  
||Neutropenia/hematologic reactions|May be related to high doses and prolonged duration.|  
  
---  
  
|ANTIBACTERIAL(S)|POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS|COMMENTS|  
|---|---|---|  
|Vancomycin|**Nephrotoxicity**|Risk increases with vancomycin trough levels >20 μg/mL or concomitant administration with other potentially nephrotoxic agents. The effect is usually reversible.|  
||Infusion reaction formerly known as “**red man syndrome**”|Can be managed with a slower vancomycin infusion and pretreatment with antihistamine.|  
|Fosfomycin|Gastrointestinal effects||  
|TMP-SMX|Hypersensitivity reactions|Allergy usually associated with sulfonamide moiety|  
||**Nephrotoxicity**|Associated with high doses|  
||**Hematologic effects**|Associated with prolonged use|

#### Exposures  
  
* Exposures, both occupational and social, may provide clues to likely pathogens.   
* When relevant, inquiries about exposure to **ill contacts, animals, insects, and water** should be included in the history, along with **sites of residence and travel**.  
  
---  
  
#### Other Host Factors  
  
* Age, renal and hepatic function, and comorbid conditions are all considerations in the choice of and schedule for therapy.   
	* Dose adjustments should be made accordingly.   
* In patients with decreased or unreliable oral absorption, IV therapy may be preferred to ensure adequate blood levels of drug and delivery of the antibacterial agent to the site of infection.   
* In general, initial treatment for severe and life-threatening infections is given by intravenous injection to assure prompt and adequate drug delivery.  
  
---  
  
### DURATION OF THERAPY  
  
* Whether empirical or directed, the duration of therapy should be determined in most clinical situations.   
* **Guidelines** that synthesize available literature and expert opinion provide recommendations on therapy duration that are based on infecting organism, organ system, and patient factors.   
* In general, where data on adequate durations of therapy exist, **shorter courses** are preferred to reduce the likelihood of drug adverse effects and selection of resistant bacteria.  
  
---  
  
### FAILURE OF THERAPY  
  
* If a patient does not respond to therapy, investigations often should include **imaging and the collection of additional specimens** for microbiologic testing as indicated.   
* Failure to respond can be the result of an antibacterial regimen that does not address the underlying **causative organism**, the development of **resistance** during therapy, or the existence of a focus of infection at a site **poorly penetrated** by systemic therapy.   
	* Some infections may also require surgical interventions (e.g., large abscesses, myonecrosis).   
* Fever due to **allergic drug reactions** can sometimes complicate assessment of the patient’s response to antibacterial treatment.
