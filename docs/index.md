Ditched Notion for Obsidian for some time, as Notion takes forever to open a big, fat note. However, Obsidian isn’t very sharable without the paid Publish feature.

Finally set up this site so I can look something up in my notes while I’m seeing patients in the out-patient department or in jail!

My Notion site is still functioning, although a bit out-dated:
- [Infectious Disease](https://didiowen.notion.site/336e4bf161d347f1a4ef74a78c55aade?v=1c01c8b26b084d9d92605f5ded2f27ce&pvs=74)
- [Hematology](https://didiowen.notion.site/Hematology-b1a003097226464d9b6e861560fe7dc7?pvs=74)

BTW, the site name is inspired by Cate Blanchett’s [Notes on a Scandal](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/notes_on_a_scandal)
