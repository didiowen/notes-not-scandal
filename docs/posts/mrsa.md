(AII). Some experts recommend the addition of rifampin 600 mg QD or 300–450 mg BID to the chosen antibiotic (BIII). For children ≥12 years of age, linezolid 600 mg PO/IV BID should be used. A single-strength and DS tablet of TMP-SMX contains 80 mg and 160 mg of TMP, respectively. For an 80-kg adult, 2 DS tablets achieves a dose of 4 mg/kg. |
